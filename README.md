# Streaming Analysis
I have set up this analytical project to examine the rise and development of the streaming age. A number of streaming platforms have developed over the years to challenge the hold of Netflix on the market, but how is the market resonding to this?


## Datasets
I have had to use publicly available data to perform these analyses. Statista have access to more in depth data if you are interested in delving further into this topic. However, these data are only available to paid subscribers.

The following data sources were utilised here:
- Search Logistics
- Business of Apps
- Wikipedia (Paramount Plus)
